# 5. Thirty hours (三十个小时)

![Thi is my new home](images/6.jpg)

My life has become quite routine. The kind-hearted person tried several cat foods, and we've settled on a routine. I have two main meals each day, which consist of meat soup and meat strips. I also have access to dry food with chicken bits anytime I want; I snack on it during the day and at night. The kind-hearted person also gives me a little treat when I'm well-behaved, like returning home on time.

The kind-hearted person's life is also quite regular. She leaves for work every day in the morning and returns in the evening. When she comes back, we go for a walk together in the large green space, and then we have dinner. After dinner, I go out to play on my own near the garden, and when it gets dark, I return home. Sometimes, I get so carried away playing that I lose track of time, and that's when the kind-hearted person comes out to find me. She holds a keychain with bells and rings them as she walks, so I can hear the sound and come home with her.

This routine is really nice. I feel a bit sad when the kind-hearted person leaves in the morning, but knowing she'll be back after work makes me feel better. Usually, I just go upstairs to sleep. In the evening, as soon as the kind-hearted person opens the door, I can hear it, and I come downstairs immediately. She pats my head and asks if I had a good day. Then, we go out for a walk together.

However, one day, the kind-hearted person didn't come back. She didn't return in the evening. Because I didn't hear the sound of her opening the door, I overslept. When I woke up, it was already very dark, and I was alone in the house. I noticed that the kind-hearted person had prepared dinner for me and left a lot of dry food. She must have known she wouldn't be coming back today. But without seeing her, I couldn't eat.

I went up and down the stairs, not knowing when the kind-hearted person would return. I was a bit worried and restless. I didn't know what to do, so I just sat in front of the window in the living room.

It was at this moment that I witnessed something I had never seen before – the neighbors were arguing!

I couldn't quite make out who was arguing with whom, but I saw the elderly neighbor arguing with the young couple, and then the elderly neighbor arguing with the family of three. There were also some strangers who seemed to have come to visit the young couple. I noticed that these guests initially parked their cars in front of the young couple's house, then in front of the elderly neighbor's house, and later in front of the French woman's house. I guess it was an argument about parking.

After some time, the neighbors outside finally quieted down, and I went to the kitchen to prepare something to eat.

That's when I heard the kind-hearted person's voice. It wasn't the sound of the door opening; it was coming from a corner in the kitchen. I listened carefully, and eventually, I spotted a round object, almost like an eye, facing me. The kind-hearted person's voice was coming from there, and she was calling my name.

I looked at that "eye" and called out a few times. I thought the kind-hearted person must be facing some issue that prevented her from coming back, so she was communicating with me through that "eye."

She said she would be back soon and asked me to eat well and wait for her.

After eating, I went upstairs to sleep. It wasn't until the evening of the next day that the kind-hearted person finally returned! I had spent a total of thirty hours on my own. When she came back, she took me for a walk, and the fresh air outside felt great!

我的生活已经很有规律了。好心人试了几种猫食，现在基本定了。我每天吃两次主餐，是肉汤和肉条，我的辅食随时都有，是一种含鸡肉的干食，我白天的时候会吃一些，晚上也会吃一些。好心人还会给我吃一种小零食，当我很乖的时候，比如按时回家。

好心人的生活也很有规律，她每天上班，一早离开，黄昏回来。她回来以后，我们就去大绿地一起散步，然后吃晚餐。晚餐后，我会自己出去在花园附近玩，等到天黑的时候，我就会回到家。有的时候，我玩得太兴奋了就忘记了时间，这时候好心人会出来找我，她拿着有铃铛的钥匙，一路走，一路摇着铃铛，我会听到铃声，然后就跟她回家。

这样的生活真的很好，每天早晨好心人离开的时候，我有点儿感伤，但是想到她下了班就回来了，我就不难过了。我通常就跑到楼上去睡觉了。晚上的时候，只要好心人一开门，我就会听到，我会马上下楼。她会摸摸我的额头，问我是不是度过了愉快的一天。然后，我们就一起出门散步。

不过有一天好心人没有回来，没有在晚上的时候回来。因为我没有听到好心人的开门声，所以就睡过头了。我醒来以后，天已经很黑了，房子里只有我自己。我注意到好心人给我准备了晚餐和很多干食，她一定是知道她今天不回来了。可是见不到好心人，我也吃不下去。

我从楼上到楼下，又回到楼上，又下来。我从客厅走到厨房，又走回客厅，我不知道好心人什么时候回来，我有点儿担心她，也有点儿烦躁。我不知道做些什么，就在客厅的窗前坐着。

就在这个时候，我看到了从来没发生过的事情，是邻居们在吵架！

我弄不清楚是谁和谁在吵，但是我看到了邻居老太太和年轻夫妇在吵，然后老太太又和一家三口在吵。还有一些陌生人，他们应该是来年轻夫妇家做客的。我还看到那些客人先是把车停在了年轻夫妇家门口，后来又停到了老太太家门口，再后来停到了法国女人家门口。我想这是因为停车而吵起来的吧。

过了一段时间，外面的邻居们总算安静下来了，我到厨房里准备吃些东西。

这时候我听见了好心人的声音，不是开门的声音，是从厨房的一个角落里发出来的。我四处听听，终于发现了一个圆圆的东西，好像一直眼睛对着我。好心人的声音就是从那里发出来的，她在喊我的名字。

我看着那个眼睛，我也叫了几声，我想一定是好心人有什么事回不来，她才通过那个眼睛跟我说话的。

她说她很快就会回来，让我好好吃饭，等她回来。

吃过了东西我就上楼睡觉了。第二天早晨，还是没有见到好心人。我又吃了点儿东西，就睡了。

直到第二天的晚上，好心人终于回来了！我自己度过了三十个小时！好心人回来以后就带我出去散步了，外面新鲜的空气真好！
