# 3. I have a name! (我有了名字!)

![Thi is my new home](images/3.jpg)

Over these two weeks, the kind-hearted lady made several preparations for me to go outside. Besides the vet visits, she also bought me a collar. On it, she wrote her address and phone number because she was worried I might get lost, and with the collar, someone could contact her. It was a pink collar, and I think she wanted people to know I was a female cat. It was my first time wearing a collar, and it was a bit uncomfortable at first. I kept trying to use my paws to remove it, but it wouldn't come off. After a day or two, I started getting used to it.

The kind-hearted lady also added some bells to her keychain, just like Mr. Bell did. She would jingle them, and I would follow her outside.

The weather outside was really nice. I could smell the flowers and the grass, hear the birds and dogs, and even the buzzing of bees among the flowers. We left the house and headed toward a green area, on the other side of the garden of a wealthy family. This green area was on a small hill, with the kind-hearted lady leading the way, and I followed behind her. We climbed the small hill and reached the end of this green area. The kind-hearted lady stopped there, standing and gazing into the distance. I sat down beside her and looked out at a beautiful field, an endless expanse of green. With just one glance, the green stretched all the way to meet the blue sky and white clouds. Blue, green, green, blue. We stayed there for a long time, appreciating the beautiful scenery of the English countryside. I gently rubbed my head against the kind-hearted lady's leg, wanting her to know that I loved this place!

After a while, we started walking in the opposite direction, toward the west, where the sun was setting. The white clouds in the sky were gradually turning red, and the sun was also a warm red color. The kind-hearted lady continued walking west, and I followed her. Occasionally, I would run ahead of her and then sit down and wait for her. Eventually, we descended from the hill, making a complete loop around the green area, and it felt so comfortable.

On our way back home, we met a neighbor who stopped to chat with the kind-hearted lady and introduced herself. She said she had been watching me walking with the kind-hearted lady on the green area and that I was such a cute little cat. She also had a cat, a gray one. I stopped to listen to them talking, and I saw the neighbor's cat inside the house, watching us from the windowsill. The neighbor asked the kind-hearted lady for my name, and I didn't have a name yet, so how would the kind-hearted lady respond?

"She's called Bell," the kind-hearted lady said.

Oh, like the sound of a bell. I guess it's because Mr. Bell brought me here.

"She likes to follow Bell around, so I call her Bell," the kind-hearted lady explained to the neighbor.

From that day on, I had a name. My name was Bell, or in Chinese, "铃灵" (Ling Ling).

I liked the sound of bells, so I was called Bell.

Starting today, I go outside every day. Sometimes, I play on the green area in front of the house, and sometimes in the backyard's green area. After work, if the weather is good, the kind-hearted lady takes me to the large green area, and we watch the sunset together.

Sometimes, even after sunset, I continue to wander in the green area. If I haven't returned home by the evening, the kind-hearted lady would come to find me by shaking her bells. She really is a kind-hearted lady.

这两个星期好心人为我出门做了不少准备，除了去看兽医，她还买了一个颈环给我。上面写上了她的住址和电话，她担心我跑丢了，有了颈环就会有人联系她。这是一个粉色的颈环，我想她是想让人知道我是一只母猫。这是我第一次戴颈环，开始不是很舒服，我总想用我的脚试着把它摘下来，不过摘不下来，过了一两天慢慢适应了。

好心人还像铃铛先生一样在她的钥匙上面加了几个铃铛，她和铃铛先生一样摇着铃铛，就让我跟着她出门了。

外面的天气真好，我能闻到花香，草香，听见鸟叫，狗叫，还有花间的蜜蜂的声音。我们从家里出来，走向一个绿地，这个绿地在富人家花园的另一边。这个绿地在一个小山坡上，好心人在前面走，我就在后面跟着她，上了小山坡，走到这片绿地的尽头，好心人停住了，她站在那里遥望远方。我就在坐在她的旁边，看到一片美丽的田野，无边无界的绿色。一眼望去，绿色的尽头就是蓝天，白云。蓝色，绿色，绿色，蓝色，我们就在那里停留了很久，欣赏这美丽的英格兰乡村的风景，我用我的头蹭了蹭好心人的腿，我想让她知道，我喜欢这个地方！

我们停留了一会儿，就向绿地的另一个方向走，那是西边，是太阳落山的方向。天边的白云开始慢慢泛红。太阳也是红红的颜色，好心人就这样一直往西走，我跟着她。偶尔我还跑起来，跑到她的前面，然后坐下来等她。然后，我们就下山了，绕了绿地刚好一周，太舒服了。

回家的路上，我们遇到了一个邻居，她停下来和好心人搭话，介绍她自己。她说她一直在看我跟着好心人在绿地走，说我是一只太可爱的小猫了。她也有一只猫，是一只灰色的猫。我停下来听她们说话，我看见了这个邻居家的猫，比我个头大一些。他正躲在房子里，在窗台上望着我们。邻居问好心人我的名字，我还没有名字啊，好心人会怎么说呢？

“她叫铃灵”，好心人说。

哦，就是铃铛的声音，我想是因为我是铃铛先生带来的吧。

“她喜欢跟着铃铛走，我就叫她铃灵，你叫她的时候像铃铛，她就会知道了。” 好心人和邻居解释着。

从那一天起，我有了名字，我叫铃灵。

我喜欢铃声，所以叫铃灵。

从今天开始，我每天都出门了，我有时候在房子前面的绿地玩，有时在后花园的绿地玩，好心人每天下班之后，如果是好天气，她都带我去大绿地，我们一起去看夕阳。

有时候看过夕阳，好心人回家，我还继续在绿地里逛。如果晚上我还没回去，好心人会摇着她的铃铛来接我回家。她真的是一个好心人啊。
