# 5. A new neighour (来了一个新邻居)

![Thi is my new home](images/5.jpg)

The kind-hearted person's neighbor moved away, and a new neighbor recently moved in.

How did I find out? Well, when I used to play in the garden, I could always hear the neighbor's dog barking, but recently, that barking has stopped. One day, I quietly jumped into the neighbor's garden, and I saw the room was empty, and of course, the dog was no longer there.

I've played in the neighbor's garden a few times, but that was after the old neighbor moved out. I knew a new neighbor had moved in recently, an elderly lady. Today, while playing in that garden, I was chased out by her.

I was sitting on one of the garden steps, watching a little bird on a plum tree when suddenly I heard a loud noise, and the door opened. An elderly lady came out from her living room, holding a feather duster, and she yelled at me, "Did you mess up the garden?" She approached me with the feather duster, and I got scared and ran away.

A few days later, the new neighbor came to visit the kind-hearted person's home. I wanted to hear what she had to say.

Sure enough, she talked badly about me to the kind-hearted person! She asked if I normally use a litter box, and the kind-hearted person quickly apologized, saying she would train me gradually. She also asked the kind-hearted person who would take care of me when she wasn't at home. The kind-hearted person began, "I was thinking, if I'm not..." but the elderly lady interrupted, "I'm sorry, I can't help you with that because I'm allergic to cat fur." "Oh, I see. I didn't know that. I'm sorry for inviting you over for tea today. Will you be uncomfortable?" "No worries, I'll just sit for a while."

That day, the elderly lady did more than just sit for a while. She asked the kind-hearted person many questions, and the kind-hearted person answered all of them. Questions like how to apply for an Amazon account to shop online, garbage collection times, what can be recycled, and information about the neighbors, such as their names. She also asked about how utility bills for water, electricity, and gas are paid in the kind-hearted person's house, and so on.

I never dared to go into the kitchen during that time because I didn't want her to see me.

For the next few days, I didn't go to the elderly lady's garden anymore.

During the day, when the kind-hearted person was at work, I would stay home alone. I liked to sit on the window sill in the living room because from there, I could see what was happening outside. Usually, it was quiet here. There were six houses in this small lane, including the kind-hearted person and the elderly lady, as well as a young couple, a retired elderly couple, a family of three, and finally, a single French woman.

From what I remember, the French woman only spoke to the kind-hearted person once. That day, I ran up to her front door because she was unloading things from her car, and I was curious. But at that moment, the French woman quickly closed the trunk of her car and threatened me, saying, "Don't even think about getting on my car." The kind-hearted person came over and said, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry." The French woman replied, "It's okay, I won't let the cat near my car." She looked cold and spoke in a very distant manner. I stayed under the kind-hearted person's feet the whole time, and I wouldn't go near the French woman's front door again.

Actually, apart from the kind-hearted person's house, it's dangerous to go anywhere else now. The young couple has a dog, a very aggressive one that barks loudly at anyone. It's impossible for me to get close to their house. The family of three has two cats, both of which are also very unfriendly. The elderly couple has a cat, and I dare not go near there either.

Not going to the neighbors' houses isn't a problem, though. I like the kind-hearted person's garden and the large green space where I can watch the sunset.


好心人的邻居家搬走了。最近又搬进来一个新邻居。

我是怎么知道的呢？因为之前我在花园里玩的时候，我总能听到邻居家的狗叫，最近这叫声没有了。有一天我悄悄的跳进邻居家的花园里，我看到房间空空的，什么都没有，当然那只狗也不在了。

我在邻居家的花园玩过几次了，当然是在旧邻居搬走以后。我知道最近新邻居搬进来了，是一个老太太。我今天在那个花园里玩的时候，我被她赶出来了。

我那时候正在她的花园的一个台阶上坐着，我在看一棵梅花树上的小鸟，突然我听到咣的一声响，门开了，一个老太太从她客厅的玻璃门出来，手里还拿着一个鸡毛掸子，她对我吼着：“是不是你把花园弄脏的？” 说着，她拿着鸡毛掸子靠近我。我吓得赶紧跑了。

过了几天，新邻居来好心人家做客了。我想听听她说些什么。

她果然找好心人说我的坏话！她问好心人我平时是不是用猫砂盆？好心人连忙跟她抱歉，说她会慢慢培训我的。她还问好心人，如果她不在家的时候，谁照看我。好心人刚开口说：“我在想呢，如果我不在，您能不能帮我个忙…” 这个老太太还没等好心人说话，她就说起来：“太抱歉了，我帮不上你这个忙，因为我对猫毛过敏。” “哦，是这样啊，我不知道是这样，今天冒昧的请你来我这里喝茶，您会不会不舒服啊？” “没事，没事，我就小坐一会儿。”

那天老太太并不是小坐了一会儿，她问了好心人好多问题，好心人都帮她回答了。比如，怎么申请亚马逊的帐号可以在网上买东西，什么时间是回收垃圾，什么垃圾可以回收，还有附近的邻居都是做什么的，叫什么名字。还有好心人家里的水电煤气都是怎么缴费的，等等等等…

我一直都没敢到厨房里去，因为我不想让她看见我。

接下来的几天，我都没有去老太太家的花园了。

白天好心人上班以后，我就一个人在家里。我喜欢坐在客厅的窗台上，因为在那里我可以看见外面都发生了什么。通常这里都很安静的，这个小巷里一共有六户人家，除了好心人和老太太还有一对年轻夫妇，一对退休的老夫妻，还有一个是一家三口，最后一个是一个独身的法国女人。

记忆中法国女人只和好心人讲过一次话，那天我跑到了法国女人家门前，她正在从车上搬运东西到家里，我很好奇就跑过去，不过这时候法国女人迅速地把车后备箱的门关上了，她威胁着对我说：“想都别想上我的车。” 这时候好心人走过来了，她对法国女人说：“对不起，对不起。” 法国女人说，“没关系，我不会让猫跑到我的车上的。” 她看上去冷漠，说起话来也很冷漠。我一直都躲在好心人的脚下，我不会再去法国女人家门前闲逛了。

其实，除了好心人家，现在去哪里都很危险。年轻夫妇家里有一条狗，特别凶的狗，它见到任何人都会大叫个不停。我是不可能靠近他们家的。一家三口家里有两只猫，也很凶。老夫妇的家里也有一只猫，我也不敢靠近那里。

不去邻居家也没有问题，我喜欢好心人的花园，还有可以看夕阳的大绿地。
