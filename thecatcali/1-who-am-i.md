# 1. Where am I from? (我从哪里来？)

![Thi is me](images/1.jpg)

I am a three-colored calico cat, and I am three years old this year. I have been wandering the streets since I can remember.

It was a residential area, and most of the time, I roamed in the central garden. During the day, I would chase butterflies and small birds, and sometimes, in the evenings, I would encounter hedgehogs or mice. Late at night or early in the morning, I would sometimes see foxes. They were quite large and brave, often jumping into the gardens of the residents. If I spotted them, I would find a tree to climb because I didn't want them to discover me.

I was probably born in March 2020, a time when the whole city and the country were said to be under lockdown. I knew that there were people in every household; I could see them during the day and the lights in their homes at night. But no one came out, and even if they did, they wouldn't come to the central garden. They were always in a hurry and wore masks. Despite the central garden being beautiful in all seasons, they had no interest in appreciating it. So, the central garden had always been mine, the cat. Until around one and a half years old, it seemed like the situation changed, and I began to see more people.

The mornings and evenings in the central garden were interesting. Pedestrians would pass through the garden, and I would follow them for a while. Some people would stop and sometimes even talk to me. Most people would just walk past, and even if I followed them for a while, they wouldn't notice me, and they would slowly leave me behind. They must have been busy with work. In the evenings, it seemed like the same pedestrians would pass through again, likely on their way home from work. Sometimes, they would stop and look at me. Sometimes, I would follow a pedestrian all the way to their home if they lived near the central garden. They would give me some food, and then I would leave. I knew that wasn't my home, and I preferred to roam freely around the central garden.

Starting in March 2022, I began to visit one of these pedestrians' homes regularly, and I could recognize him. He had a bell on his keychain. When he walked through the central garden, he would shake the bell in his hand as if to tell me he had arrived, and I would immediately follow him to his house for dinner. Let's call him Mr. Bell.

This routine continued for several months, and sometimes, I would spend the night at Mr. Bell's house, and he would even play with me. His house was filled with all sorts of cardboard boxes, and it was so much fun to jump from one to another, up and down, something I couldn't do in the central garden. Later, I found out he was moving.

Before he moved, he took me to the vet. It was the first time I had ever been to a vet in my life, and I didn't like it. I tried to escape his hands and may have even bitten him. He yelled for his assistant, and I hid in a corner of the examination room, knowing there was nowhere to run. Eventually, the vet's assistant came with thick gloves to prevent me from biting, and they caught me in the corner. They used a machine to scan me to see if I had a microchip, which would indicate an owner. The scan revealed no chip; I was a true stray cat. The vet suggested that Mr. Bell advertise to see if anyone would claim me.

I think maybe I did have an owner, but I was born during the lockdown, and everything was too difficult. Perhaps my owner had their own difficulties and left me in the central garden. After a month of advertising with no one claiming me, Mr. Bell took me to a new house, which belonged to one of his friends. He entrusted me to her care. She seemed familiar, but I didn't know what to call her, so let's call her the kind-hearted lady.

The kind-hearted lady's house was a red one, and before I even got a chance to memorize it, I was brought into the living room. I walked through the living room and into the kitchen. I liked the glass door in the kitchen, which offered a view of the garden. I saw many roses and another cat, who ran away as soon as it saw me. I heard the kind-hearted lady tell Mr. Bell that it was the neighbor's cat. I also heard Mr. Bell telling the kind-hearted lady that she should keep me in the room for two weeks to get used to it because if I went outside, I might get lost and not find my way back home.

我是一只三色印花猫，我今年三岁了，从我有记忆开始，我就在街上流浪。

那是一片住宅区，我大部分时间都在街心花园里逛，白天追追蝴蝶和小鸟，晚上有时会遇上刺猬或老鼠。深夜或凌晨有时候会见到狐狸，它们个头儿挺大的，胆子也大，经常会跳进居民家的花园里。我要是看见他们，就找棵树爬上去，我可不想被他们发现。

我大概是出生在2020年的三月，那时候据说全城，全国都封锁了，我知道家家都有人，我可以看得到他们的，白天看得到他们在家里的身影，晚上看得到他们家里的灯光，可是没有什么人出来，就算出来了，他们也不到街心花园里来，来去匆匆的，还戴着口罩。尽管街心花园的春夏秋冬都很美，他们也毫无心思欣赏。所以一直以来，街心花园就属于我，一只猫。直到我一岁半的时候，似乎情况变化了，我可以看到越来越多的人了。

街心花园的早晨和黄昏很有趣，那时候会有行人穿过街心花园，我会跟着他们走上一段，有些人会停下来，有时候会看着我，跟我说几句话，大部分的人都会匆匆走过，就算我跟在他们身后走上一段，他们不会注意我，然后就把我慢慢甩开了，他们应该是忙着工作去了吧。黄昏的时候，似乎是同样的这些行人又会从这里通过，他们应该是结束了一天的工作，在回家的路上，这时候，也会有人偶尔停下来，看看我。我有的时候会一直跟上一个行人，一直到他的家里去的，如果他们就住在街心花园附近。他们会给我一些好吃的，然后我就离开了。我知道那不是我的家，我更喜欢在街心花园附近自由自在的闲逛。

2022年的三月开始，我开始经常去一个行人家里我已经能认出他了。他手上有一个铃铛，应该是一个钥匙环带着一个铃铛。他走过街心花园的时候，就摇着手里的铃铛，好像是告诉我他来了，我就马上跟在他后面，到他家里去吃晚餐。我就称他是铃铛先生吧。

这样的日子持续了有几个月，我有的时候在铃铛先生家里过夜，他有时候还陪我玩。他的家里堆满了各种纸箱，那些纸箱高高矮矮的堆在那儿可好玩了，我从一个跳到另一个，上上下下，这是街心花园没有的。后来我才知道，他要搬家了。

他搬家之前，带我去看兽医。那可是我有生以来第一次看兽医。我不喜欢那个兽医，我拼命逃出他的双手，我好像是咬伤了他，他大声的呼喊他的助手。我躲在诊室的一个角落，我知道没处可逃。后来兽医的助手来了，戴了一副厚重的手套，防止我把他咬伤，然后到角落里，一把把我抓起来。他们用一个机器给我扫描，想知道我是不是有芯片，如果有，就可以知道我的主人是谁。扫描的结果是我没有芯片，就是没有主人，我是一只地地道道的流浪猫。兽医建议铃铛先生登广告，看看有没人认领我。

我想我或许有主人，但是我出生的时候刚好赶上封锁，一切都太艰难了，可能我的主人也有他的难处，就把我留在了街心花园。广告登出一个月后， 也没有人认领我，我被铃铛先生带着到了一个新房子，这是他朋友的家。他把我托付给了他的一个朋友。她看上去似曾相识，我不知道该怎么称呼她，就称她是好心人吧。

好心人的家是一个红色的房子，我还没有记住它的样子就被带进了客厅，我穿过客厅，到了厨房。我喜欢厨房里的玻璃门，从那里可以看见花园。我看见了很多玫瑰花，还有一只猫，它看到我就跑走了，我听到好心人告诉铃铛先生，那是邻居家的猫。我还听见铃铛先生告诉好心人，要把我关在房间里适应两个星期，不然如果让我出去，我会迷路，会找不到家了。
